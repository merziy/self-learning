# Hello!

## Description

This is my general repo where I store the majority of the code I write when I am learning new technologies, methodologies, and occasionally code that comes from entrance tests during coding interviews. While some of these projects are complete, many are not, and none of these are meant to display my coding style as they are to display my curiosity and variety of interests. The more complete project folders usually have a readme/documentation, but again, not all of them do.

Please take the code in some of my other repositories as indicators of my coding knowledge and style.

## Contents

Programming languages include Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, PHP, C, Kotlin, really, a little bit of everything. Includes JS frameworks and libraries such as React, Vue, Angular, jQuery, and more. I experiment with RESTful API's, the backend, servers, PWA's, scripting, etc.
